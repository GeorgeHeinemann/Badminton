# Historical badminton match analysis

This folder contains 4 files, an Excel Data model, a PowerBi file and an IPython file. There is also a folder containing the original source data taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/intandea/badminton-dataset) and a folder containing outputs from the Excel Data model used in the IPython file.

The Excel file contains a relational data model created using Excel's built in Power features. This can be accessed from the 'Powerpivot' tab or through regular pivot tables.

The PowerBi file is built upon the Excel data model, benefiting from the compatibility between the two programmes. 4 dashboards have been built showing various insights from the data.

The .ipynb file uses output data from the Excel data model to explore whether any basic prediction models can predict match results.
